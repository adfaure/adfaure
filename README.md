## About me

Full-stack developer located in Grenoble â›°ðŸš , France. I am passionate about computer-science and distributed softwares, such as data pipelines or workflow systems. I love learning new languages and concepts.

My objective is to become a software architect to help build scalable and resilient distributed architectures.

As a Nix enthusiast, I took some time to configure my system. You can check my [configuration](https://github.com/adfaure/nix_configuration).
